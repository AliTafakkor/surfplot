brainplot: A Python package for plotting brain surfaces
=======================================================

``brainplot`` is a flexible and easy-to-use package that makes publication-ready brain surface plots. Users can easily set the plot views and layout, add multiple data layers, draw outlines, and further customize their figure directly using matplotlib. 

At its core, ``brainplot`` is just a unified high-level interface to `Brainspace's <https://brainspace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ already *excellent* surface `plotting <https://brainspace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_doc/api_doc/brainspace.plotting.html>`_ and `manipulation <https://brainspace.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_doc/api_doc/brainspace.mesh.html>`_ capabilities, which are built on top of `Visualization Toolkit (VTK) <https://vtk.org/>`_. ``brainplot`` is designed around common use-cases for surface plotting and popular surface plotting software (e.g., `Connectome Workbench <https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/connectome-workbench>`_). ``brainplot`` also provides some additional utility functions to streamline the plotting process.
